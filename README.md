# QCP: A Practical Separation Logic-based C Program Verification Tool

## File Structure
- `linux-binary/`, `win-binary/`, `mac-x86-64-binary/`, `mac-arm64-binary/`: Precompiled QCP binaries, including `symexec`, `StrategyCheck`, `lsp`, and `mcp`.
- `QCP_examples/`: Annotated C programs used as QCP inputs. Current subtrees are `Applications_human/`, `QCP_demos_human/`, `QCP_demos_LLM/`, and `LLM_bench/`.
- `SeparationLogic/`: Rocq libraries and generated verification artifacts used to check QCP-generated VCs. Its `examples/` subtree mirrors the main `QCP_examples/` layout.
- `mcp/`: MCP server integrations. `mcp/qcp-mcp/` provides the QCP MCP server, and `mcp/rocq-mcp/` is a submodule for Rocq interaction.
- `.agents/`: Agent-facing verification workflow assets. It contains local skills for orchestration, annotation, VC checking, VC proving, and final consistency checks.
- `AGENTS.md`: Repository-level contract for agents working on end-to-end C verification cases.
- `.codex/`, `.vscode/`, `.devcontainer/`: Local agent/editor/container configuration.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for repository-level analysis.
- `tutorial/`: Step-by-step QCP usage guide.
- `run-example-linux.sh`, `run-example-windows.sh`: Scripts that run QCP examples and refresh generated Rocq files.
- `categories.json`, `categories.md`: Case categorization metadata.
- `qide.vsix`: QCP VS Code extension.


## Environment Setup

We provide two environment setup options:

1. Non-Docker local environment setup (build and run directly on your host machine).
2. Docker-based environment setup (recommended for reproducibility).

You can choose either option according to your needs.

### Local Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Rocq 8.20.1 (Coq 8.20.1), recommended with OCaml 4.14.1

Optional (only if you use MCP locally):
- `uv` (for `qcp-mcp` / `rocq-mcp` Python environment)
- `opam` + `coq-lsp` (for `rocq-mcp` interactive tools)

#### Configure Setup

To compile generated Rocq files in `SeparationLogic/`, create `CONFIGURE` (no extension) in both:

- `SeparationLogic/CONFIGURE`
- `SeparationLogic/unifysl/CONFIGURE`

Example `CONFIGURE` content:

```ini
COQBIN = /absolute/path/to/coq/bin/
```

For windows user, you must explicitly set `SUF = .exe` in the `CONFIGURE` file:

```ini
COQBIN = /absolute/path/to/coq/bin/
SUF = .exe
```

If you use wsl, we recommend installing Rocq 8.20.1 via opam. 

1. Install Opam (if not already):
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install opam
opam init
eval $(opam env)
```
2. Install Rocq 8.20.1:
```bash
opam install coq.8.20.1
```

With this approach:

- No CONFIGURE file is needed.

- You can use the vsrocq extension in VS Code directly.

#### Rocq Files Build

Then you can compile Rocq files:

```bash
cd SeparationLogic/unifysl
make depend && make
cd ..
make depend && make
```

If you only want part of the generated files under `SeparationLogic/examples`, the build targets are split by the current example groups:

```bash
cd SeparationLogic

# Core libraries only
make depend-core && make core

# All generated examples
make depend-examples && make examples

# Only one examples subtree
make depend-examples-applications && make examples-applications
make depend-examples-qcp-democases && make examples-qcp-democases
make depend-examples-llm-friendly-cases && make examples-llm-friendly-cases
make depend-examples-llm-bench && make examples-llm-bench

# Clean outputs without removing everything
make clean-core
make clean-examples
make clean-examples-applications
make clean-examples-qcp-democases
make clean-examples-llm-friendly-cases
make clean-examples-llm-bench
make clean-deps
```

This is useful because `SeparationLogic/examples` is organized into `Applications_human`, `QCP_demos_human`, `QCP_demos_LLM`, and `LLM_bench`, and you no longer need to regenerate dependencies for all example folders every time.
The clean targets follow the same split, so you can remove only core outputs, all example outputs, one example subtree, or just the generated dependency files.

### Docker Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Docker installed ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Visual Studio Code ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- VS Code Remote - Containers extension ([Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers))

#### Build the Docker Image

Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
docker build --build-arg MAKE_JOBS=5 -t qcp .
```

This will build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

#### Run VS Code Devcontainer

1. Check the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file exists in the project root.
2. Open the project root folder in VS Code.
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. VS Code will build the container and set up the environment automatically.

## QIDE Extension

### Setup

The QIDE extension for VS Code should be automatically installed and configured when using the devcontainer setup. If not, follow these steps:

- Install the QIDE extension from the VS Code UI.
  (Note that we did not publish the extension to the marketplace, so do not search for it in the extensions shop.)
  - Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
  - Select "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
  - Choose the VSIX file `qide.vsix` from the project root.
- QIDE extension settings: open `File > Preferences > Settings`, search for `qide`, and set:
  - `qide.lspBinPath` to the path of the QCP binary (e.g., `linux-binary/lsp`)
  - `qide.lspArg` is the excution options for QCP. You can leave it empty refer to `Options to run QCP`.

### Usage

- Open an annotated C program.
- Move the cursor to any place you like and press `Alt+Rightarrow`.
  You can change the keyboard shortcuts settings if needed.
  You can also run the command `qide.interpretToPoint` directly from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

### QCP Command-Line Tool

The `run-example-linux.sh` and `run-example-windows.sh` scripts in the root directory give examples of how to run QCP command-line tool. You can directly execute them if you have the required environment set up.

Below is a summary of the main command-line options of QCP. We also recommend following the tutorials in the `tutorial/` folder for a comprehensive guide.

**Usage:**
```
linux_binary/symexec [options]
```

**Required options:**
- `--input-file=<file>`: Specify the input C source code.
- `--goal-file=<file>`: Output file for generated verification conditions (VCs).
- `--proof-auto-file=<file>`: Output file for automatically solved VCs.
- `--proof-manual-file=<file>`: Output file for VCs requiring manual proofs.

**Optional flags:**
- `--gen-and-backup`: If output files exist, back them up before overwriting; otherwise, only "proof-manual" is backed up.
- `--no-exec-info`: Suppress intermediate information during symbolic execution.
- `--coq-logic-path=<path>`: Specify the Coq logic path for the goal file.
- `-slp <dir> <path>`: Add a directory to the strategy search paths.
- `-I<dir>`: Add a directory to the include search paths.

**Preprocessing:**
If your C source uses preprocessor directives (`#define`, `#include`, etc.), preprocess it first:
```
cpp -C <input-file> <output-file>
```
Note: Only `#include` is natively supported.

**Coq Integration:**
The generated `.v` files must be used with SeparationLogic. For details, see `SeparationLogic/README.md`.

## MCP Setup

The `mcp/rocq-mcp` directory is a git submodule. Before configuring MCP, make sure submodule content is initialized and up to date.

From the project root:

```bash
# Initialize and update submodules
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

After updating submodules, verify `mcp/rocq-mcp/README.md` exists.

If you do not install uv, you can use the following command to install : 
```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### 1) Configure `qcp-mcp`

```bash
cd mcp/qcp-mcp
uv venv .venv
uv sync
```

Set `mcp/qcp-mcp/CONFIGURE`:

```ini
QCP_MCP_BIN=/absolute/path/to/qcp/mcp/binary
```

eg : 
```ini
QCP_MCP_BIN=/mnt/d/coq/qcp-binary-democases/linux-binary/mcp
```

### 2) Configure `rocq-mcp`

Install and prepare in submodule:


```bash
cd mcp/rocq-mcp
uv tool install ".[interactive]"
```

`rocq-mcp` interactive tools rely on `pet` from `coq-lsp`. We recommend installing `coq-lsp` via `opam`.

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian example):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y opam bubblewrap
opam init -y
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install -y coq-lsp
pet --version
```

macOS (Homebrew example):

```bash
brew install opam
opam init -y
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install -y coq-lsp
pet --version
```

Windows:

- Recommended: use WSL2 (Ubuntu), then run the Linux commands above.
- Native Windows opam setup is possible but less stable for this workflow.

### 3) IDE Setup

**VSCode Copilot**

Create or edit `.vscode/mcp.json` in the project root.

Linux/macOS example:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "qcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/qcp-binary-democases/mcp/qcp-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
          "-m",
          "qcp_mcp.server"
      ],
      "env" : {
          "PYTHONPATH": "/absolute/path/to/qcp-binary-democases/mcp/qcp-mcp/src",
          "QCP_MCP_CONFIG": "/absolute/path/to/qcp-binary-democases/mcp/qcp-mcp/CONFIGURE"
      }
    },
    "rocq-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "rocq-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ROCQ_WORKSPACE": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

eg : 
```json
"servers": {
      "qcp": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "/mnt/d/coq/qcp-binary-democases/mcp/qcp-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
        "args": [
          "-m",
          "qcp_mcp.server"
        ],
        "env" : {
          "PYTHONPATH": "/mnt/d/coq/qcp-binary-democases/mcp/qcp-mcp/src",
          "QCP_MCP_CONFIG": "/mnt/d/coq/qcp-binary-democases/mcp/qcp-mcp/CONFIGURE"
        }
      },
      "rocq-mcp": {
        "command": "rocq-mcp",
        "env": {
          "ROCQ_WORKSPACE": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
      }
    }
```

After editing `mcp.json`, enable/start the servers from VS Code MCP server list.

- `mcp/qcp-mcp/README.md`
- `mcp/rocq-mcp/README.md`

## Agent Verification Workflow

The repository includes agent-specific instructions for running a complete verification case, not just isolated edits. The top-level `AGENTS.md` is the entry point. Detailed phase contracts live under `.agents/skills/`.

The supported verification modes are:

- `direct proof`: annotate a C program, run symbolic execution, prove generated Rocq VCs, and perform final checks.
- `refinement proof`: relate a C program to an abstract monadic program, prove the refinement obligations, and finish the same Rocq/final-check workflow.

The phase state machine is:

```text
intake -> annotation -> goal-frozen -> vc-checking -> vc-proving -> final-check -> done
```

Downstream phases may return to `annotation` or `vc-proving` when they expose stale inputs, annotation bugs, or proof obligations that require earlier fixes.

### Agent Roles

- Main agent: owns phase transitions, official file writes, symbolic execution, Rocq compilation, final checks, and case status records.
- `annotation-subagent`: works only in annotation scratch files, uses `annotation-filling`, and runs `annotation-checking` before anything is integrated into official files.
- `vc-checking-subagent`: uses `vc-checking` to classify manual VCs and produce proof grouping hints.
- `vc-proving-subagent`: uses `vc-proving` to prove manual VCs in proving scratch files, normally through the scripted concurrent worker pipeline.

### Agent Skills

- `.agents/skills/verification-orchestrator/`: phase ownership, state machine, scratch lifecycle, formal file boundaries, artifact templates, and stale-input rules.
- `.agents/skills/annotation-filling/`: spec-first and predicate-first C annotation work using isolated annotation C scratch plus `annotation_scratch_lib`.
- `.agents/skills/annotation-checking/`: quality gate for mathematical specs, function contracts, assertions, and loop invariants before official integration.
- `.agents/skills/vc-checking/`: semantic triage of generated VCs and proof group planning.
- `.agents/skills/vc-proving/`: scripted proof splitting, worker preparation, concurrent proving, validation, helper migration, and manual proof verification.
- `.agents/skills/final-check/`: final structure audit, symexec freshness check, Rocq compilation, `Admitted`/extra `Axiom` review, and cleanup checks.
- `.agents/skills/annotation-and-symbolic-execution/`: legacy annotation workflow kept for compatibility; new cases should use `annotation-filling` plus `annotation-checking`.

## Evaluation

Our evaluation consists of two parts: the Tool component and the VSCode Extension component. 
- The Tool component allows you to check files in the ``QCP_examples`` tree by running ``sh ./run-example-linux.sh``, and it generates the corresponding Coq files in the ``SeparationLogic/examples/`` directory, grouped under ``Applications_human/``, ``QCP_demos_human/``, ``QCP_demos_LLM/``, and ``LLM_bench/``.
- The Rocq build in ``SeparationLogic/`` mirrors this layout with folder-specific targets: ``examples-applications``, ``examples-qcp-democases``, ``examples-llm-friendly-cases``, and ``examples-llm-bench``, together with matching ``depend-examples-*`` targets.
- The VSCode Extension component is designed to support real-time verification interaction. You can open any annotated C file to view the current assertion state, which facilitates the continued writing of annotations for proofs.
